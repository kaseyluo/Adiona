Adiona is a web-app prototype that ensures safe commutes, especially for young women. The user sees three buttons: yellow, orange, and red. If nervous, the user clicks the yellow button, which allows the user's real-time movement to be tracked. If feeling more nervous, the user clicks the orange button, which sends his/her message of distress and location to those on her emergency contact list. If in a life-threatening situation, the user clicks the red button, which calls 911 and sends help to her location. 

There is also a map button that allows the user to see locations of nearby police stations and safe zones, so that he/she can make smart decisions as they commute. 

Adiona was created during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at AT&T 2016 as a final project.
